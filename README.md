# Start Mkdocs

Start Mkdocs is a quick starter for mkdocs. So, we don't need to bother configuring mkdocs to use it.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhexa/start-mkdocs.git
```
- start adding the markdown files inside the `docs` directory
```
- .vscode/
- docs/
  -- index.md
  -- <add-new-file-here>.md
- .gitignore
- ...
```
